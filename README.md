DML is a language to express what your data looks like and what logic is embedded within your data.

## Why
Legacy data practices are notorious for introducing logic within the data, making it hard to validate or generate 
data records. Engineers often revert to excel to express this logic, but it does not seem to be the right tool for the job.

Using toolkits like MPS allows a specific language to be designed with the previous in mind; a simple language to express data and the logic within it.
